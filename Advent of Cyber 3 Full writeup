Task 13  [Day 8] Special by John Hammond Santa's Bag of Toys

Answer the questions below
Read the premise above, start the attached Windows analysis machine and find the transcription logs in the SantasLaptopLogs folder on the Desktop.

If you want to RDP into the machine, start the AttackBox and enter the following into a terminal: xfreerdp /u:Administrator /p:grinch123! /v:MACHINE_IP - The credentials for the machine are Administrator as the username, and grinch123! as the password.

No answer needed
Each transcription log is a simple plain text file that you can open in any editor of your choice. While the filenames are random, you can get an idea as to which log "comes first" by looking at the Date Modified or Date Created attributes, or the timestamps just before the file extension!

Open the first transcription log. You can see the commands and output for everything that ran within PowerShell, like whoami and systeminfo!

What operating system is Santa's laptop running ("OS Name")?

Microsoft Windows 11 Pro
Review each transcription log to get an idea for what activity was performed on the laptop just after it went missing. In the "second" transcription log, it seems as if the perpetrator created a backdoor user account!

What was the password set for the new "backdoor" account?

grinchstolechristmas
In one of the transcription logs,  the bad actor interacts with the target under the new backdoor user account, and copies a unique file to the Desktop. Before it is copied to the Desktop, what is the full path of the original file? 

C:\Users\santa\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat
The actor uses a Living Off The Land binary (LOLbin) to encode this file, and then verifies it succeeded by viewing the output file. What is the name of this LOLbin?

certutil.exe
The UsrClass.dat file was encoded with Base64, which thankfully, you can decode and recover the original UsrClass.dat file!  Base64 decode the contents between the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE----- markers within the transcription log with CyberChef, which you have a local copy of on the Desktop of your analysis machine. 

This file can be used to aid in our investigation. The UsrClass.dat file contains "Shellbags," or artifacts contained within the Windows registry that store user preferences while viewing folders within the Windows Explorer GUI. If you could carve out this information, you could get an idea as to what user activity was performed on the laptop before it was stolen or compromised! For more details and information on Shellbags, you are strongly encouraged to do some extra reading or research. :)

To extract the Shellbags information within this UsrClass.dat file, we will use the "Shellbags Explorer" graphical utility put together by Eric Zimmerman. This utility is found readily available inside the ShellBagsExplorer folder on the Desktop of your Windows machine, with the application name ShellBagsExplorer.exe .



Read the above and open the ShellBagsExplorer.exe application found in the folder on your Desktop.

No answer needed
With ShellBagsExplorer.exe  open, use the top-bar menu to select File  -> Load offline hive and navigate to the location of where you saved the decoded UsrClass.dat . Load in the UsrClass.dat file and begin to explore the Shellbags discovered!



Under the Desktop folder, there seems to be a suspicious folder named "SantaRat". Could this be a remote access trojan, that was used for further nefarious activity on Santa's laptop? Unfortunately, from just Shellbags alone, we only have insight into folder names (sometimes files, if we are lucky) and column data within Windows Explorer, but not files... how could we uncover more details?

Drill down into the folders and see if you can find anything that might indicate how we could better track down what this SantaRat really is. What specific folder name clues us in that this might be publicly accessible software hosted on a code-sharing platform?

.github
Additionally, there is a unique folder named "Bag of Toys" on the Desktop! This must be where Santa prepares his collection of toys, and this is certainly sensitive data that the actor could have compromised. What is the name of the file found in this folder? 

bag_of_toys.zip
Track down this SantaRat software online. It may be just as simple as searching for the name of the software on the suggested website (Github).

Note that the TryHackMe Windows analysis machine does not have Internet access, so you will need to explore in your own web browser.



What is the name of the user that owns the SantaRat repository?

Grinchiest
Explore the other repositories that this user owns. What is the name of the repository that seems especially pertinent to our investigation?

operation-bag-of-toys
Read the information presented in this repository. It seems as if the actor has, in fact, compromised and tampered with Santa's bag of toys! You can review the activity in the transcription logs. It looks as if the actor installed a special utility to collect and eventually exfiltrate the bag of toys. What is the name of the executable that installed a unique utility the actor used to collect the bag of toys?

uharc-cmd-install.exe
In the last transcription log, you can see the activity that this actor used to tamper with Santa's bag of toys! It looks as if they collected the original contents with a UHA archive. A UHA archive is similar to a ZIP or RAR archive, but faster and with better compression rates. It is very rare to see, but it looks the Grinch Enterprises are pulling out all the tricks!

You can see the actor compressed the original contents of the bag of toys with a password. Unfortunately, we are unable to see what the specific password was in these transcription logs! Perhaps we could find it elsewhere...

Following this, the actor looks to have removed everything from the bag of toys, and added in new things like coal, mold, worms, and more!  What are the contents of these "malicious" files (coal, mold, and all the others)?

GRINCHMAS
We know that the actor seemingly collected the original bag of toys. Maybe there was a slight OPSEC mistake, and we might be able to recover Santa's Bag of Toys! Review the actor's repository for its planned operations... maybe in the commit messages, we could find the original archive and the password!



No answer needed
What is the password to the original bag_of_toys.uha archive? (You do not need to perform any password-cracking or bruteforce attempts)

TheGrinchiestGrinchmasOfAll
McSkidy was able to download and save a copy of the bag_of_toys.uha archive, and you have it accessible on the Desktop of the Windows analysis machine. After uncovering the password from the actor's GitHub repository, you have everything you need to restore Santa's original bag of toys!! 

Double-click on the archive on the desktop to open a graphical UHARC extraction utility that has been prepared for you. Using the password you uncovered, extract the contents into a location of your choosing (you might make a "Bag of Toys" directory on the Desktop to save all the files into).

With that, you have successfully recovered the original contents of Santa's Bag of Toys! You can view these in the Windows Explorer file browser to see how many were present.

How many original files were present in Santa's Bag of Toys?

Answer the questions below
Help McSkidy and run nmap -sT MACHINE_IP. How many ports are open between 1 and 100?
2
What is the smallest port number that is open?

22
What is the service related to the highest port number you found in the first question?

HTTP
Now run nmap -sS MACHINE_IP. Did you get the same results? (Y/N)

Y
If you want Nmap to detect the version info of the services installed, you can use nmap -sV MACHINE_IP. What is the version number of the web server?

Apache httpd 2.4.49
By checking the vulnerabilities related to the installed web server, you learn that there is a critical vulnerability that allows path traversal and remote code execution. Now you can tell McSkidy that Grinch Enterprises used this vulnerability. What is the CVE number of the vulnerability that was solved in version 2.4.51?

CVE-2021-42013
You are putting the pieces together and have a good idea of how your web server was exploited. McSkidy is suspicious that the attacker might have installed a backdoor. She asks you to check if there is some service listening on an uncommon port, i.e. outside the 1000 common ports that Nmap scans by default. She explains that adding -p1-65535 or -p- will scan all 65,535 TCP ports instead of only scanning the 1000 most common ports. What is the port number that appeared in the results now?

20212
What is the name of the program listening on the newly discovered port?

telnetd

Task 16  [Day 11] Networking Where Are The Reindeers?

Answer the questions below
You decided that the first step would be to check the running services on MACHINE_IP. You resort to yesterday’s tool, Nmap.

Knowing that MACHINE_IP is a MS Windows system, you expect it to not respond to ping probes by default; therefore, you need to add -Pn to your nmap command to perform the scan. This instructs Nmap to skip pinging the target to see if the host is reachable. Without this option, Nmap will assume the target host is offline and not proceed with scanning.

There is an open port related to MS SQL Server accessible over the network. What is the port number?

1433
Knowing the MS SQL Server is running and accessible over the network, we want to check if our username and password are still valid. Using the AttackBox terminal, we will use the command sqsh (pronounced skwish), an interactive database shell.

A simple syntax would be sqsh -S server -U username -P password, where:

-S server is used to specify the server, for example -S MACHINE_IP
-U username is used to provide the username; for example, -U sa is the username that we have enabled.
-P password lets us specify the password.
Let’s try to run, sqsh -S MACHINE_IP -U sa -P t7uLKzddQzVjVFJp

If the connection is successful, you will get a prompt. What is the prompt that you have received?

1>
McDatabaseAdmin told us the database name is reindeer and it has three tables:

names
presents
schedule
To display the table names, you could use the following syntax, SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition.

SELECT * is used to return specific columns (attributes). * refers to all the columns.
FROM table_name to specify the table you want to read from.
WHERE condition to specify the rows (entities).
In the terminal below, we executed the query, SELECT * FROM reindeer.dbo.names;. This SQL query should dump all the contents of the table names from the database reindeer. Note that the ; indicates the end of the SQL query, while go sends a SQL batch to the database.

Pentester Terminal
pentester@TryHackMe$ sqsh -S MACHINE_IP -U sa -P "t7uLKzddQzVjVFJp"
1> SELECT * FROM reindeer.dbo.names;
2> go

Check the table schedule. What is the destination of the trip scheduled on December 7?

Prague
Check the table presents. What is the quantity available for the present “Power Bank”?

25000
You have done fantastic work! You have helped McDatabaseAdmin retrieve the schedule! Now, let’s see if we can run MS Windows commands while interacting with the database. Some MS SQL Servers have xp_cmdshell enabled. If this is the case, we might have access to something similar to a command prompt.

The command syntax is xp_cmdshell 'COMMAND';. Let’s try a simple command, whoami, which shows the user running the commands. In the terminal output below, after connecting to MS SQL Server, we tried xp_cmdshell 'whoami';, and we can see that the user is nt service\mssqlserver. This means that any command we pass to xp_cmdshell will run as nt service\mssqlserver.

Pentester Terminal
pentester@TryHackMe$ sqsh -S MACHINE_IP -U sa -P "t7uLKzddQzVjVFJp"
1> xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
2> go

	output

[...]

	nt service\mssqlserver
    
	NULL
    
(2 rows affected, return status = 0)
We can run other commands that we can execute on the MS Windows command line. For example, we can use dir to list files and directories and type filename to display the contents of a file. Consider the example in the terminal window below where we reveal the contents of the text file WindowsUpdate.log.

Task 17  [Day 12] Networking Sharing Without Caring

Answer the questions below
Scan the target server with the IP MACHINE_IP. Remember that MS Windows hosts block pings by default, so we need to add -Pn, for example, nmap -Pn MACHINE_IP for the scan to work correctly. How many TCP ports are open?
7
Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that allows the ability to transfer files between different computers and is available on many systems, including MS Windows and Linux. Consequently, NFS makes it easy to share files between various operating systems.

In the scan results you received earlier, you should be able to spot NFS or mountd, depending on whether you used the -sV option with Nmap or not. Which port is detected by Nmap as NFS or using the mountd service?

2049
Now that we have discovered an NFS service is listening, let’s check what files are being shared. We can do this using the command showmount. In the terminal below, we run showmount -e MACHINE_IP. The -e or --exports show the NFS server’s export list.

Pentester Terminal
pentester@TryHackMe$ showmount -e MACHINE_IP
Export list for MACHINE_IP:
/share        (everyone)
/my-notes     (noone)
As we can see in the terminal output above, we have two shares, /share and /my-notes. After you have started the attached machine, use the AttackBox terminal to discover the shares on MACHINE_IP.

How many shares did you find?

4
How many shares show “everyone”?

3
Let’s try to mount the shares we have discovered. We can create a directory on the AttackBox using mkdir tmp1, where tmp1 is the directory’s name. Then we can use this directory  we created to mount the public NFS share using: mount MACHINE_IP:/my-notes tmp1.

Pentester Terminal
pentester@TryHackMe$ mount MACHINE_IP:/my-notes tmp1
mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting MACHINE_IP:/my-notes
We can see that the mounting has failed. my-notes is not public and requires specific authentication mechanisms that we don’t have access to. Let’s try again with the other folder, share.

Pentester Terminal
pentester@TryHackMe$ mount MACHINE_IP:/share tmp1
We didn’t get any error messages, so it was a success. Let’s go inside the share to see what’s inside it using cd tmp1, then ls.

Pentester Terminal
pentester@TryHackMe$ ls
132-0.txt  2680-0.txt
There are two text files. We can open the file using any text editor such as nano FILENAME or something quicker such as less FILENAME.

What is the title of file 2680-0.txt?

Meditations
It seems that Grinch Enterprises has forgotten their SSH keys on our system. One of the shares contains a private key used for SSH authentication (id_rsa). What is the name of the share?

confidential
We can calculate the MD5 sum of a file using md5sum FILENAME. What is the MD5 sum of id_rsa?
